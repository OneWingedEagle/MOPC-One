//the input file faraday3D.m matlab code
//the program calculated the faraday rotation of a slab of magneto-optic photonic crsystal with limitted thinkness
//the slab is, in general, placed between two  media1 and media3 with electric permittivities of eps1 and eps3 //respectively.
// the crystal is made of a 2D array of bars located in a background. The bas cross-section could be either //eliptical or rectangular
//The first input parametrer is GEOMETRY which describes the bar cross-section being elliptical or rectangular
//GEOMETRY =0 indicates eliptical, GEOMETRY =1 is for rectangular
//GEOMETRY

//Rx Ry
//fi  anticlockiwise angle of elipse axis with x-axis.  angle is given in degrees.
0
//theta  angle of incident light in degrees.
// theta =0 means the light direction is perpendicular to the slab
// second value is for the mode of incidence. 0: E-polarization, 1: H-polarization
